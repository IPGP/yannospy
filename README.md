# PyModes
This repository contains classes to handle elastic eigenfunctions of the Earth.
At the moment these need to be calculated using the normal mode code 'yannos'.
Kernel calculation is available but NOT YET PROPERLY BENCHMARKED. The code will
soon be able to compute some simple seismograms.

YOU ARE WELCOME TO USE IT BUT THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND CONTAINS BUGS AND
ERRORS
