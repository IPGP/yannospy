# PyModes
This repository contains some classes that I use to handle elastic
eigenfunctions of the Earth. At the moment these need to be calculated using
the normal mode code 'yannos'. Ultimately it is should be able to calculate
kernels and some simple seismograms.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND CONTAINS BUGS AND ERRORS
